# MODULE4_DEEP_ANALYTICS

(using R statistical programming language.)


Increasingly, technology companies are applying data analytics techniques to the masses of data generated by devices such as smart phones, appliances, vehicles,
electric meters, et cetera. The ability to deal with data of these types will prove to be a high-demand skill for data analysts as applications of commercial 
interest increasingly go beyond business intelligence. The skills you will learn are applicable to a wide variety of data analytics projects and will enable you to
start working on problems that benefit from the application of machine learning and statistical analysis techniques to sensor (and other) data.



In this module, we will be working for an "Internet of Things" technology start-up that wants to use Data Analytics to solve two difficult problems in the physical world. 

Smart energy usage: Modeling patterns of energy usage by time of day and day of the year in a typical residence whose electrical system is monitored by multiple sub-meters.
Indoor locationing: Determining a personâ€™s physical position in a multi-building indoor space using wifi fingerprinting.


Perform visualizations, and then generate descriptive statistics and predictive models using both statistical classifiers and linear regression 
techniques. 

In this course we will work on:

- Define the business purpose of a data analytics project and make a principled, realistic analysis plan
- Install and using the R statistical programming language and R Studio
- Manage data in R
- Explore data using visualization techniques and descriptive statistics in R
- Choose and evaluate classification modeling techniques in R
- Choose and evaluate regression modeling techniques in R
- Analyze time series data
- Interpret performance metrics
- Perform error analyses
- Present highly technical, engineering-oriented data mining results to business management.
